<p dir="ltr" style="line-height: 24px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; With the English language skills and multimodal communication strategies I acquired from ENGL 1101, I continued on my journey of maturing into a competent communicator. During the course of this semester, I successfully demonstrated my improved abilities to put the communication concepts and rhetorical skills gained from my previous English course into actual practice. More importantly, when composing the three new artifacts different from those of English 1101, I learned to appreciate the strengths of my teammates and thus discovered new aspects of communication modes that I could further work on. While becoming a matured communicator overall, I particularly focused on the effective communication within a group to maximize output by emphasizing each member’s unique strength, research on the internet to incorporate convincing evidences produced by credible sources, and individual practice on a new form of creative writing that emphasizes the use of specific rhetorical elements including figurative languages and impressionism. Overall, by completing all three artifacts, I’ve grown into a more effective communicator who can proficiently use all modes from the WOVEN communication skill set.</p>

<p style="line-height: 24px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; Video assignments are not novel to me especially after I have acquired useful technical skills from the assignments done in ENGL 1101. However, the first group book trailer project still challenges me since it is different from conventional video production in many ways. Situated in the setting of <em>Waiting for the Barbarians</em> written by J.M. Coetzee, the book trailer must introduce its main characters and reflect one of its themes without giving the whole story away. First of all, unlike making a simple video where the filming and editing processes are so short that there are few needs to differentiate the two, our group set up the goal of making a professional video in the most organized way. To do so, we outlined specific stages of producing this artifact: identifying the theme of the book, picking scenes for filming, choosing dialogues for scripting, writing a proposal for evaluation, and these listed are just preparation work before shooting the trailer video, let alone the actual filming and editing phase. It is worth mentioning that this video production process is a dynamic one in that we did go back and forth between the multiple stages when we identified some problems occurred during each stage such as recording of undesirable scenes, missing one or two important lines, and unsuccessful editing resulted from imperfect filming.</p>

<p style="line-height: 24px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Thus, besides staying organized by strictly following the procedure, our group also benefited from the most fundamental aspect of a group project: teamwork, where each individual exerts their most confident strengths to generate an efficient workflow that maximizes our output. Thanks to the collaboration between all the group members, we could recognize the most meaningful scenes, decide the most desirable setting, film from the most appropriate angle, act with most natural moves, and finally, edit using the most professional software toolset. The final outcome, as we all have expected, is a masterpiece video that incorporates all elements of WOVEN communication modes. However, it is more than merely a combination of communication modes, as these elements collectively create an extraordinary effect in term of conveying a powerful message to the audience. The video successfully demonstrates the extreme usefulness of using WOVEN communication modes as the audience can clearly read the settings, the characters, and the tones of the story without knowing much about the book’s content, and therefore becomes enticed to read the whole piece. In short, due to the contribution of each team member, this particular video assignment is a symphony of all WOVEN modes organically combined to effectively communicate the desired message to the intended audience.</p>

<p style="line-height: 24px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; The Artifact II assignment, as interesting yet challenging as the first book trailer project, requires students to record a discussion on a minority related topic of their own choice, which can potentially be globalization, multiculturalism, or diversity and so on. Like many other typical students, I had written well-organized essays, had created sophisticated videos, and had designed nicely-crafted posters. However, I had never tried making a podcast, where the sound is the only source of cues used for expressing arguments and discussing pieces of evidence. Limiting the source of information to sound adds an extra level of difficulty to this project, yet this is also where I learned with other team members how to construct convincing arguments backed by specific examples and enhanced by special sound effects. After finalizing our topic choice to be how minority populations are underrepresented in award shows such as Oscars, each of us we immediately started conducting research on the web regarding their own individual subtopics. It was through this process we differentiated between different sources and settled down on exactly what would be included in the podcast as examples, and therefore to have promoted our critical thinking and research skills.</p>

To do so, we not only structured the podcast similar to a well organized argument-driven essay, but also included other sound elements such as breaks, background music, and tone changes to reflect and enhance the effectiveness of the underlying theme. Thanks to the adequate preparation we completed beforehand, the actual recording and editing went smoothly with high efficiency far beyond our expectation. When looking back to what we have accomplished as a group, I realized the engaging nature of a podcast lies in the effectiveness of the deployment of each specific sound element which in conjunction with others conveys a powerful overall image to the audience. Artifact II turned out to be both challenging yet rewarding in that it provided me with an excellent opportunity to take the driver’s seat and explore such deployment.</span></p>

<p style="line-height: 24px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; Unlike a conventional argumentative essay assignment, the writing project I received in this course emphasizes on fine details, individuality, and creativity. Artifact III consists of writings of vivid snapshots of one’s personal life experiences called vignettes. For each one of the three vignettes I was about to create, I needed to show imagery of a story instead of plainly telling them, which should be achieved by using detailed descriptions, rhetorical skills, and impressionistic techniques. On the other hand, the three vignettes, seemingly disjointed in terms of the content, must unify into a consistent theme traceable in each piece. It did not take too long for me to finalize my topic to my unique living experience as an exchange student and then identify the potential theme of transition and acceptance. Guided by a listed outline, I quickly finished the rough draft for revision. Contrary to an argumentative essay, which I can usually structure out neatly using a template in the first place so that it does require major revision afterward, it turned out I did not have enough control on the quality of the first draft, and hence a handful revisions had to take place both in my self-review and peer review phase. In further drafts, to match my writing style closer to the genre of vignettes, I particularly paid attention to the use of figurative language. For example, I would compare a hummingbird to a dancing fairy, a desert garden with a swimming pool to a pearl in the ocean to create subtle impressions in the reader’s mind.</p>

<p style="line-height: 24px;">&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; A major challenge to me is that due to my writing style mostly adapted to a conventional argument-driven essay, my vocabulary choice and expressions are unfortunately dull as well as imprecise. With this note in mind, I devoted much of my time to explore the most exquisite way to express each scene I had created with detailed descriptions in actions, moods, and the environment. Overall, my focus shifted from narration to description, and the latter would be more effective in impressing the audience for them to perceive what I had experienced and learned from the exchange year. After completion of this assignment, I was amazed at how writing, the most important yet routine part in WOVEN communication modes, is actually broader and more dynamic than I had conceived it to be. After all, the writers themselves ultimately decide the way to express their ideas, the use of different styles, elements, and the modes used to communicate a variety of functions to the readers. In a nutshell, the vignette assignment opened a new gate for me within the scope of written communication in WOVEN.</p>

Taking an overview of the college English classes I took in the past year (2 semesters), I have been exposed to virtually all modes of communication and felt more comfortable with which I used to struggle. The longer I retain and use these skills, the more I realize how they can benefit the rest of my life whenever I need to communicate myself to others under any circumstance.</p>
